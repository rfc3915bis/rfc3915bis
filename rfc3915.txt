   This document uses URNs to describe XML namespaces and XML schemas
   conforming to a registry mechanism described in RFC 3688 [8].  Two
   URI assignments were requested and have been registered by the IANA.

   Registration request for the registry grace period namespace:

   URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:rgp-1.0

   Registrant Contact: See the "Author's Address" section of this
   document.

   XML: None.  Namespace URIs do not represent an XML specification.

   Registration request for the registry grace period XML schema:

   URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:schema:rgp-1.0

   Registrant Contact: See the "Author's Address" section of this
   document.

   XML: See the "Formal Syntax" section of this document.

8.  Security Considerations

   The mapping extensions described in this document do not provide any
   security services beyond those described by EPP [1], the EPP domain
   name mapping [2], and protocol layers used by EPP.  The security
   considerations described in these other specifications apply to this
   specification as well.

   As with other domain object updates, redemption of a deleted domain
   object MUST be restricted to the sponsoring client as authenticated
   using the mechanisms described in sections 2.9.1.1 and 7 of RFC 3730
   [1].  Any attempt to recover a deleted domain object by any client
   other than the sponsoring client MUST be rejected with an appropriate
   EPP authorization error.
